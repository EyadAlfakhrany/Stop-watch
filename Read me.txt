##  How It Works

1. **Initialization**
   - Ports, LCD, Buttons, and LED are initialized.
   - A welcome message `hallo` is displayed on the LCD.

2. **Time Setting**
   - **Button 1**: Increment hours.
   - **Button 2**: Increment minutes (rolls over to 0 after 59).
   - **Button 3**: Increment seconds (rolls over after 59 and increments minutes).
   - **Button 4**: Start countdown.

3. **Countdown Mode**
   - Time is shown and decremented each second.
   - LED turns ON during countdown.
   - Countdown can be stopped by pressing **Button 4** again.
   - When the timer reaches 00:00:00:
     - LED turns OFF.
     - Buzzer sounds repeatedly.
     - LCD displays: `time ended`.

##  Example

- Set time: `01:30:15`
- Start countdown.
- At `00:00:00`: LED OFF, Buzzer ON, LCD shows `"time ended"`

##  Future Improvements

- Add software debounce to buttons.
- Use hardware timers instead of `_delay_ms()` for better accuracy.
- Add reset and resume functions.
- Add EEPROM save/restore last timer values.
